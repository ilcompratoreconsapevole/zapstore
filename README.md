## Introduction

Zapstore aims to provide the best ever experience for an **"App Store"** which doesn't tell you to leave your data or could request to pay with an ancient **FIAT** system payments. 

Everytime a service tells you to authenticate with a **KYC** procedures or leaving your personal data like **(email,password,ID CARD,Credit Cards)** could expose them to a data breach.

Zapstore would change these practices with help of [NIP-05](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/05.md) or `npubs` that we use to access to [NOSTR](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr).
